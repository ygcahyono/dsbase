        in Grab Indonesia. This base usage of this package is to pull the data from our Presto database using 
        pydatagateway to become Pandas DataFrame.
        
        
        ## Installation.
        
        1. Clone the depedencies.
        	a. Anaconda (preferably using Anaconda 3.5+)

        	$ conda install -c anaconda mysql-connector-python
        	'''
        
        	b. Install pydatagateway, geopandas, shapely
        	'''
        	$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
        	'''

        ## Functions.
        
        ### Day to day work.
        
        - [Presto](#1-presto)
        	- [x] Query to Pandas DF.
<<<<<<< HEAD
        	- [ ] Delete table from Database.
        	- [ ] Insert rows to existing table.
        - [Geohash](#2-geohash)
        	- [x] Create Geohash file from geofences list.
        - [Google Sheet](#3-google-sheet)
        	- [ ] Read google docs from known docs name.
=======
        	- [x] Develop functions that could execute several sql queries. Eg: insert, drop, and delete.
        - [Geohash](#2-geohash)
        	- [x] Create Geohash file from geofences list.
        - [Google Sheet](#3-google-sheet)
        	- [x] Read google docs from known docs name.

        ### Data Science related work.
        
        - [x] Slovin's Formula
        
        
        
        ## How to do.
        
        ### Presto.
        Gather data from Presto Hive Grab Database and return `Pandas format DataFrame`.
        
        - `def queryPr(query, verbose = 1):`: 
        
        	example:
        	```
        	Q = ('''
        	select * from public.prejoin_bookings limit 10
        	''')
        	df = queryPr(Q)
        	```
        
        ### Geohash
        Turn the list of pair coordinate into Geohash file that can be used to determine specific location so we can pull the exact 
        booking rides (f0r example) from database.
        
        	example:
        	```
        	# set the geofence.
        	lists = [106.75665329101594, -5.9485476420121, 106.87214100000006, -5.91722502774615, 106.93003999999996, -5.752303, 106.72691199999997, -5.775628, 106.72918747070298, -5.94171811791231, 106.75665329101594, -5.9485476420121]
        
        	# convert it to csv file with the determine properties.
        	convert_polygon_to_geohash(list, name = 'default', precision= 6, city_id = 10, country_id = 6, city_name = 'Jakarta')
        	```
